## Heroku Buildpack: nginx

This buildpack was forked from
https://github.com/thinkful/nginx-buildpack and modified
to discard the cloudflare IP configuration.

The original repo at https://github.com/ryandotsmith/nginx-buildpack was focused on 
running nginx AND another app server in the target dyno, and synchronizing start and exit for
both.  This version is for nginx alone, serving static content or proxying or whatever.

### Versions

The versions of nginx, PCRE, and the "headers_more" module are 
configured in scripts/build_nginx.sh

* NGINX Version: 1.6.2
* PCRE Version: 8.36 
* HEADERS_MORE Version: 0.25 

All are fetched from their authoritative homes (URLs configured
in build_nginx.sh as well).  Build is cached in the app cache 
so it should only compile nginx the first time you run it.  

### Usage 

To create a new app using this buildpack, clone your app's
repository and make sure you have a config/nginx.conf.erb.  From
within the clone:

```
   $ heroku create --buildpack http://github.com/powersupplyhq/nginx-buildpack.git
   $ git push heroku master
```
(heroku magically creates a remote called 'heroku')

You should see the buildpack download, build, and install nginx
and its dependencies.  

The built files will be cached by Heroku so it won't build every
time you push a change to your app.  To clear the cache and force
a rebuild (say, for a new version of nginx) you can install the
heroku-repo tool: 

https://github.com/heroku/heroku-repo

It adds a command to the heroku command line app to flush the 
buildpack cache:

```
   $ heroku repo:purge_cache --app <appname>
```

The file 'config/nginx.conf.erb' will be processed through `erb`
to create `nginx.conf`.  The only thing that `erb` is really
getting you is the expansion of the PORT variable but that's
necessary.  If you want to change the buildpack to use something 
besides erb, look in bin/start-nginx and scripts/build_nginx.sh 

### Features

* Unified NXNG/App Server logs.
* [L2met](https://github.com/ryandotsmith/l2met) friendly NGINX log format.
* [Heroku request ids](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/http-request-id) embedded in NGINX logs.
* Customizable NGINX config.

#### Logging

NGINX will output the following style of logs:

```
measure.nginx.service=0.007 request_id=e2c79e86b3260b9c703756ec93f8a66d
```

You can correlate this id with your Heroku router logs:

```
at=info method=GET path=/ host=salty-earth-7125.herokuapp.com request_id=e2c79e86b3260b9c703756ec93f8a66d fwd="67.180.77.184" dyno=web.1 connect=1ms service=8ms status=200 bytes=21
```

#### Setting the Worker Processes

You can configure NGINX's `worker_processes` directive via the
`NGINX_WORKERS` environment variable.

For example, to set your `NGINX_WORKERS` to 8 on a PX dyno:

```bash
$ heroku config:set NGINX_WORKERS=8
```

#### Customizable NGINX Config

You can provide your own NGINX config by creating a file named
`nginx.conf.erb` in the config directory of your app. Start by
copying the buildpack's [default config
file](https://github.com/ryandotsmith/nginx-buildpack/blob/master/config/nginx.conf.erb).

#### Customizable NGINX Compile Options

See [scripts/build_nginx.sh](scripts/build_nginx.sh) for the
build steps. Configuring is as easy as changing the "./configure"
options.
